My name is Surita B and this is my diary. My day started like any other day, just after I woke up this morning I got my breakfast and started working, I take a shower,  I had a Zoom meeting with colleagues from work.
After working I went to the gym and then meet a friend, I went home to do master's lessons.
At the end of the day, I watched an episode of a serie in Netflix, I went to la Molina, I read a chapter of my favorite book and then I went to sleep.

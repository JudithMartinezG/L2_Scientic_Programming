# L2_Scientic_Programming
The present repository has been created to develop the laboratory 2 of the Scientific Programming subject. The objective of the practice is to create a collaborative code with git using GitHub. 
In order to practice with both Git and GitHub tools, the members of the group (mentioned above) created a short collaborative story.

## History of commands
### Judith Martinez Gonzalez
First of all, I created this repository with a text file called *new story*. Then, I added the members of the group as a collaborators of the repository. After that, I created another text file called *collaborative story*. 
Since this project is divided into independent branches, one for each contributor, I created a branch called *judithmartinez*. Once it was created, I added another text file called *collaborator1_story* where I wrote some lines with personal experience of the day. Then, I did a merge from the main branch to *judithmartinez* branch. Then, I modified the file *collaborative story* adding the contents of my personal story. Finally, I merged the changes to the main branch. 

### Joaquín Américo Astete Frugoni
I accepted the invitation to participate in the *L2_Scientic_Programming repository*. I created the *joaquinastete* branch. In my branch I created a file with my history. I did a merge from the main branch to the *joaquinastete* branch with the updates of the group history. In the *joaquinastete* branch, I made the changes in the group history with the parts of my history. Once the file *collaborative story* was modified, I did a merge from the branch to the main branch.

### Anxo Lois Pereira Cánovas
I accepted the invitation to participate in the *L2_Scientic_Programming repository*. I created the *Anxo_branch* branch to edit my files. In my branch I created a file with my history. I did a merge from the main branch to my branch with with the empty group history file. In the *Anxo_branch* branch, I writed updated the group history file with my history and I prepared the file so that the rest of the team could add their part more easily. Once the file *collaborative story* was modified, I comitted and pushed the canges in both files (the group history and the file with my own history) and I did a merge from the branch to the main branch.

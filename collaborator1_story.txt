Today, I woke up at half past five to go to work. When I arrived, the first thing I did was to make a coffe, turn on my computer and start working with my robot until one o'clock. Then, I came back home to have lunch and do master's lessons. Once they finished, as it is Friday, I went to la Molina to spend the weekend.
